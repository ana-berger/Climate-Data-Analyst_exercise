abstract                 = This data was generated from the CSIRO model CCAM (version r5262M) for the Australian Climate Hazards project, over the domain known as AUS-10i (12km resolution). The regional climate model was driven using data from the CSIRO-ARCCSS global climate model ACCESS-CM2 which performed the CMIP6 experiment SSP370.
